## Don't use regular expressions to parse HTML

Locating a specific piece of HTML in a string seems like a perfect case for regular expressions. However, I advise you against it. There are many different ways that HTML can be formatted and still be considered valid HTML, but trying to capture all these possible variations in a regular expression can be tedious and error prone. A module developed specifically for parsing HTML, such as Beautiful Soup, will be less likely to result in bugs.

You can find an extended argument for why you shouldnâ€™t to parse HTML with regular expressions at http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/1893164/

## Beautiful Soup 4

[1] Use requests.get(URL) to download the page of URL -> pass the text attribute to bs4.BeautifulSoup()

[2] For downloaded HTML, us open('XXX.html')

[3] Finding element with select() method: passing a string of a CSS selector for the element you are looking for.

## Selenium Module

[1] Download the geckodriver for Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

[2] browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/geckodriver.exe')

## Other problems

[1] Beautiful Soup returns incomplete HTML on Flickr: the content is loaded via javascript -> use selenium

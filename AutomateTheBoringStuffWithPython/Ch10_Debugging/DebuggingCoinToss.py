Chapter 10 Debugging - Project: Debugging Coin Toss
Description:
    The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing
    game. The player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However,
    the program has several bugs in it. Run through the program a few
    times to find the bugs that keep the program from working correctly.
